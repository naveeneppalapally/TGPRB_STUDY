# AGENTS.md - TSLPRB StudyOS

Persistent rules for every agent working in this repo. Read this before any task. The full build spec (schema, tier template, build order) lives in `docs/build-prompt.md` - reference it, don't restate it.

## Architecture - never substitute
- Nuxt 3 + Nuxt Content. Never Astro, Next.js/Nextra.
- Nuxt UI (`@nuxt/ui`) for all components. No hand-rolled design-token system.
- Cloudflare Pages (app) + Cloudflare R2 (media). Supabase for auth/review-state/FSRS data only - never media.
- FSRS via `ts-fsrs`. Never hand-roll SM-2 or Leitner.
- No PWA, no service workers, no offline caching.
- No Framer Motion, no bespoke animation elsewhere. GSAP only for topics that pass the visual rule below. Plain CSS/Nuxt UI defaults for everything else.
- Never invoke `image-to-code`, `imagegen-frontend-web`, or `imagegen-frontend-mobile` skills on this project. No reference-image-first design workflow.

## Source data - trust hierarchy, never invert it
- `Extracted_Text/` is the only ground truth. Always re-derive tier counts and question content from here, never hardcode numbers from a prior analysis.
- `Deep_Analysis.txt` is a QA cross-check only, never a data source. Its "no negative marking / guess (2) or (3)" guidance and its cutoff numbers are confirmed wrong - never build either into the app.
- `Topic_Banks/` is a draft tagging only. A question counts toward a tier or a note only after it has a `verified_topic_id`, not just its original folder tag.
- The 2026 exam has a real 20% negative-marking penalty. Never build any "always guess" feature or copy that implies free guessing.

## Content generation - never deviate
- Tier is computed per topic from its real, verified PYQ count - never assumed from the subject's general weight. Tier 1 (10+): full note. Tier 2 (3-9): compact note. Tier 3 (<3): flashcards only, no note.
- The visual rule is independent of tier: any topic - even Tier 2 - keeps a map/diagram if its facts are genuinely spatial, chronological, or hierarchical. A flat list never gets one, regardless of tier.
- A note's comprehension-gate MCQs never enter the FSRS queue directly. Passing the gate is what unlocks the note's atomic flashcards and its real PYQs into the queue.
- Prefer real, verified PYQs everywhere. Any synthetic/practice question must be explicitly labeled as such - never presented as a real PYQ.
- Current affairs are a separate content type, never edited into a note's markdown file.
- **A topic is not done until its tagged current-affairs entries visibly render on its live note page** - not just exist as a content file. Check this in the browser for every topic, the same way you'd check the gate.

## Product logic - never deviate
- The due-review count is the homepage's dominant element - never one of several equal-weight stat cells.
- The subject list ranks by real PYQ weightage - never a static alphabetical list.

## Process
- This file is the standing constitution. Task prompts should point back to a section here ("per the tiering rule in AGENTS.md"), not restate it.
- `docs/build-prompt.md` holds the full one-time spec (schema, Tier-1 template, settings, deployment). Update it when an architecture decision actually changes - not for routine topic-by-topic work.
